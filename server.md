# Server Terms and Definitions  

## General Server Terms  
- **Server**: A computer or system that provides data, resources, or services to other computers (clients) over a network.  
- **Client-Server Model**: A computing architecture where a client requests services from a server, which processes and responds accordingly.  
- **Hosting**: The process of storing and making websites, applications, or services accessible on a server.  
- **Uptime**: The duration a server is operational and available without interruptions.  
- **Downtime**: The period when a server is unavailable due to maintenance or failure.  
- **Load Balancer**: A system that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and efficiency.  
- **Latency**: The time delay between a request and the response from a server.  

## Types of Servers  
- **Web Server**: A server that hosts and delivers web pages (e.g., Apache, Nginx).  
- **Application Server**: A server that runs applications and processes business logic (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic).  
- **Database Server**: A server dedicated to managing and providing access to databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **File Server**: A server that stores and shares files over a network.  
- **Proxy Server**: A server that acts as an intermediary between clients and other servers to enhance security and performance.  
- **DNS Server**: A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.  
- **Mail Server**: A server responsible for sending, receiving, and storing emails (e.g., Microsoft Exchange, Postfix).  

## Server Infrastructure & Configuration  
- **Bare Metal Server**: A physical server dedicated to a single user without virtualization.  
- **Virtual Server**: A software-based server running within a physical machine using virtualization (e.g., VMware, KVM).  
- **Cloud Server**: A server hosted on a cloud platform, allowing scalability and remote management (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM).  
- **Containerization**: Running applications in isolated environments (containers) using tools like Docker and Kubernetes.  
- **Hypervisor**: Software that enables virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine (e.g., VMware ESXi, Hyper-V).  
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing network traffic across multiple servers to improve reliability and performance.  
- **Failover**: A backup operation that switches to a standby server if the primary server fails.  

## Server Security & Networking  
- **Firewall**: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.  
- **SSL/TLS**: Encryption protocols that secure communication between clients and servers.  
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A protocol for securely accessing and managing servers remotely.  
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: A technology that creates a secure connection over the internet.  
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: An attack that overloads a server with excessive traffic, causing it to crash.  
- **Reverse Proxy**: A server that forwards client requests to backend servers while adding security and caching benefits.
